In the big picture of modern software engineering, Chocolatey bridges the gap
between manual software management and fully automated infrastructure as code
(IaC) practices. Its simplicity, compatibility with CI/CD pipelines, and
scalability across both desktops and servers make it a key enabler for DevOps,
LowCode adoption, and hybrid environments. As an open and extensible tool, it
integrates seamlessly with platforms like Intune, Azure, and MyGet for
enterprise use.
